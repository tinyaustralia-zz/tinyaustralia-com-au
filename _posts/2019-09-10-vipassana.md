The page is currently under construction. I will soon be publishing a personal diary/encounter of my time spent at this 10-day silent meditation in Queensland, Australia. My notes are very deep and frankly quite messy in their current form. Once I have been able to digest and process into something more articulated, I'll be publishing here. Thanks for your patience.
