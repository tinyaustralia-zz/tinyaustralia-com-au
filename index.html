<p><span class="dropcaps">T</span>iny Australia is a community of independent seekers whom have chosen a path of deeper connection and purpose.

<p>Inspired by the ancient practice of Vipassana meditation and moved by the adventurous nature of tiny-house living, we've been working hard creating a new kind of wellness centre, a meditation retreat that offers guests an experience of self-awareness, uninterupted nature, and minimalist tiny-house living in comfort, without distractions. Our aspirations to build such a place are gradually coming to fruition and while there is plenty of work ahead of us to secure real-estate and partner with tiny-home builders, we are dedicated to achieving completion by the end of 2021.</p>
