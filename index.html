	<p>Inspired by the ancient practice of Vipassana meditation and moved by the adventurous nature of tiny-house living, we've been working hard creating a new kind of wellness centre, a meditation retreat that offers guests an experience of self-awareness, uninterupted nature, and minimalist tiny-house living in comfort, without distractions.
