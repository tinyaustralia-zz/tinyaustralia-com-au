<p><span class="dropcaps roboto-slab display-1 text-danger">T</span>iny Australia is a new kind of wellness centre, a tiny-house experience focussed on helping to develop self-awareness. A community of independent seekers whom have chosen a path of deeper connection and purpose.</p>
	
<p>Our philosophy is seamingly <i>simple</i>; when we embrace minimalism by living with less<sup><a href="https://youtu.be/6Pm0Mn0-jYU" class="link-red" target="_blank">1</a></sup>, we become more joyful, abundant, and generous (the counter-intuitive nature of life). On one hand we are blessed with ever-evolving technology, while counter-intuitively, we are struggling more with depression and anxiety than ever before.</p>

<p>Inspired by the ancient practice of Vipassana meditation and moved by the adventurous nature of tiny-house living, we are working hard creating our Airbnb business that will offer its' guests a unique and comfortable minimalist tiny-house experience surrounded by the tranquility of nature, and far away from city distrations. Our retreat will offer activities centred around mindfulness practices and wellbeing.</p>

<p>Our aspirations to build such a unique getaway is gradually coming to fruition and while there is plenty of work ahead of us to secure real-estate and partner with tiny-home builders, we are dedicated to achieving completion by the end of 2021.</p>
