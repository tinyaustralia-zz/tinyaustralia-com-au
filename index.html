	<p><span class="dropcaps">T</span>iny Australia are a community of independent seekers that have chosen a path of deeper connection and purpose. Our philosophy is seamingly <i>simple</i>; by embracing minimalism (living with less<sup><a href="https://youtu.be/6Pm0Mn0-jYU" target="_blank">1</a></sup>), we become more joyful, abundant, and generous (the counter-intuitive nature of life). On one hand we are blessed with the exciting progression of technological advancements, while <i>counter-intuitively</i>, we are struggling more and more with depression and anxiety. Why is this?</p>
		
	<p>Inspired by the ancient practice of Vipassana meditation and moved by the adventurous nature of tiny-house living, we have been working hard at creating a new kind of wellness centre, a meditation retreat that offers guests an experience of self-awareness, uninterupted nature, and minimalist living in a comfortable and cosy tiny-house, without all the distractions. Although our aspirations to manifest such a dream are slowing bearing fruit, we are heavily focussed on achieving this goal over the course of the next few years, with an estimated completion date of late 2021.</p>
