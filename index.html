	<p>Tiny Australia is a community of independent thinkers who are choosing a path to uncover deeper meaning and truth in life. By embracing the minimalist lifestyle and living with less, we grow more abundant in spirit. Our philosophy is quite simply that, with too much clutter and demands on our time, there is no space for genuine self-reflection and spiritual growth. As humans, we are bogged down with far too many things competing for our attention, distracting us from what’s really taking place at a deeper, existential level. Inspired by the ancient practice of Vipassana meditation, and drawing upon its’ teachings to live every day from a place of awareness in the moment, to tune into one’s body and mind, and live from a place of love and compassion, Tiny Australia are helping to expand this practice beyond the Dhamma centres that exist across Australia, but to take the practice to a whole new level and experience.</p>
	
	<p>We are working hard to develop a new kind of meditation retreat that will embrace Tiny Home living in the style of a minimalist village.  This tranquil environment will be set in nature and offer meditators a distraction-free space to introspect. Meditators can participate in various activities that focus on mindfulness, self-observation, gratitude, connection, and various other forms of meditation classes that will be available daily. We are heavily focussed on achieving this goal over the next few years and have already made progress in funding this program. It is likely that we’ll franchise our retreats in the future, but for now we are focussed on funding the first location in Queensland, Australia. Therefore, our immediate plans are to secure real-estate and partnerships with tiny-home builders in Australia.</p>
	
	<p>We’ll be posting regular updates on our social media, and ofcourse right here on our website. For any specific questions or if you'd like more information, please get in touch with us via our community links below.</p>
