	<p<span class="dropcaps">T</span>iny Australia are a community of independent thinkers that are choosing a path to deeper purpose and meaning in life. Our philosophy is <i>simple</i>; that by embracing a minimalist lifestyle and chosing to live with less<sup><a href="#">1</a></sup>, we become more abundant, joyful, and generous (the counter-intuitive nature of life). There is just so much going on in our lives, compounded by an era of advertisers and social media marketing minipulation all fighting for our attention, it's is quite easy to see why the western-world has the highest rate of depression globally. Our minds are spread so thin there is very little space for introspection and spiritual growth.</p>
		
	<p>Inspired by the ancient practice of Vipassana meditation and the Tiny Home Movement, we are working hard to create a new kind of wellness retreat that combines the obvious benefits of these two areas. Our retreat will offer guests an environment set in nature, far away from the hustle and bustle of city-life, while providing a distraction-free and positive environment for meditators to journey inward. We are heavily focussed on achieving this goal over the course of the next few years and have already made strides in funding this program. Our focus is on rolling out our first retreat in Queensland, Australia, and place to expand nationwide by franchising over the course of 10 years.</p>
