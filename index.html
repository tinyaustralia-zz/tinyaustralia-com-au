	<p><span class="dropcaps">T</span>iny Australia are a community of independent seekers that have chosen a path of deeper connection and purpose. Our philosophy is seamingly <i>simple</i>; by embracing minimalism (living with less<sup><a href="https://youtu.be/6Pm0Mn0-jYU" target="_blank">1</a></sup>), we become more joyful, abundant, and generous (the counter-intuitive nature of life). On one hand we are blessed with the exciting progression of technological advancements, while <i>counter-intuitively</i>, we are struggling more and more with depression and anxiety. Why is this?</p>
		
	<p>Inspired by the ancient practice of Vipassana meditation and moved by the adventurous nature of tiny-house living, we've been working hard creating a new kind of wellness centre, a meditation retreat that offers guests an experience of self-awareness, uninterupted nature, and minimalist living in a comfortable and cosy tiny-house, without distractions. Our aspirations to build such a place are gradually coming to fruition and while there is plenty of work ahead of us to secure real-estate and partner with tiny-home builders, we are heavily focussed on achieving our completion goal by the end of 2021.</p>
