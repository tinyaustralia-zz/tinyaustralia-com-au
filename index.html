	<p>Tiny Australia is a community of independent thinkers that are choosing a path to deeper purpose and meaning. Our philosophy is quite simply that by embracing the minimalist lifestyle and living with less, we become more abundant (the counter-intuitive nature of life). The excessive demands on our time and attention in today's western societies, often leave very little space for introspection and spiritual growth. Inspired by the ancient practice of Vipassana Meditation, and drawing upon itsâ€™ teachings to live every day from a place of awareness, Tiny Australia are merging these two beneficial lifestyle mindsets into an experience that we can all take advantage of while one our hero's journey.</p>
	
	<p>We are working hard to develop a new kind of wellness retreat that will embrace tiny-house living while incorporating the best of Vipassana practices. Our retreats will offer guests an environment set in nature, far away from the hustle and bustle of city-life, while providing a distraction-free and positive environment for meditators to journey inward. Meditation circles will be held daily along with various other group-based activities to help guide both beginners and advanced seekers. We are heavily focussed on achieving this goal over the course of the next few years and have already made strides in funding this program. Our focus is on rolling out our first retreat in Queensland, Australia, and place to expand nationwide by franchising over the course of 10 years.</p>
